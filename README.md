##  The Problem - Shoulder Surfing

You're in a crowded place ‚Äî typing an OTP, a note, or a juicy message in your app's text interface  ‚Äî  
and suddenly someone sneaks and you're like *Paathutaan daa!*  

People around you are reading over your shoulder.

## Real-world Use Cases
Building an interface for these and beyond:
Entering passwords or OTPs in public
Writing private notes
Confusing nosy co-passengers
Just... for fun!

##  The Solution

**SoonaPaanaSecurityKit** is a simple, lightweight Swift package that lets you:

-  **Obfuscate** typed text in real-time (like `yt$%78&`)
-  **Reveal on long-press** ‚Äî temporary, like a whisper
-  Works with both `UITextField` and `UITextView`
-  **No autocorrect or spellcheck** interference
-  Easily revert obfuscated text using a confuser logic
